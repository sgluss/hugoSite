# **CVMA 2018-2019 Round 5 at Chuckwalla Raceway**
A return to Chuckwalla Raceway brings a new set of challenges! This time we ran the track counter-clockwise, so it was almost a whole new track. Due to the assymetrical nature of the track's corner complexes, I had to completely refamiliarize myself with getting into and out of the corners at speed.

This was my first round as an expert racer, up against the big kids! Furthermore, my 2009 R6 was finally up and running. While considerably more powerful than my erstwhile 600RR, it was still needing a considerable amount of setup, so I spent as much of the weekend learning the bike as re-learning the track.  
Chuckwalla's gorgeous February weather brought racers in from as far afield as Calgary Canada, and there was no shortage of pro riders either. Between the experts and the pros, I never placed better than 13th, but that didn't make the weekend any less enjoyable as I hurtled around the track with friends both old and new!

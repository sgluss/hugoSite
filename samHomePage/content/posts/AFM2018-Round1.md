# **AFM 2018 Round 1 at Buttonwillow Raceway**
After weeks of working on the bike, installing safety equipment, and getting the new front suspension in, I finally made it down to Buttonwillow raceway for my first ever motorcycle race event with AFM.

## **Race 0 - Clubman Middleweight**
This race got moved to Sunday morning due to rain.  
The pavement was cold, but I was able to secure 3rd place in a phenomenal battle with #775 Nick Csik

## **Race 2 - 750 Superbike**
Running with the big bikes was not actually the most intimidating race! This race was run twice, and red flagged (race ended due to crashes) both times.
Despite these setbacks, I was able to take second place by way of a fast lap, 2:01.34

## **Race 4 - 600 Superbike**
This class is brutally competitive. A weak start and mediocre laptimes led to a 4th place finish.

## **Race 7 - Formula 1**
Competition against medium to medium-heavy bikes (450-750cc, and 1liter twins) and an open grid. The open grid made the 1st lap of both starts absolutely hair-raising.  
This race got red flagged once, and in the second race I was able to ride to a 3rd place finish.

## **Race 11 - Legacy Middleweight**
This class is for older bikes (2007 and before) so the competition was a little less fierce. I was able to secure a 1st place finish, even beating some experts!

In the end, I beat my old personal best lap by 5 seconds (2:02-1:57) and secured podium finishes in the majority of my races. And I didn't crash!  
I'm definitely feeling more ready for Round 2 April 14-15.

## **Credits roll:**
Huge Thanks go out to:  
**Rhett Whitehill** for helping me flush everything out of the van. Can't race if you can't get there!  
**Mike Marocco** for spending his Friday night helping me get AFM-spec number plates in vinyl at the last possible minute  
**Brian Grabianowski** for being the best goddamn crew chief and drinking buddy a racer could ask for  
**Dave Thomas and Jeanne Marie** for their hospitality (Dave rode to 3 podium finished himself!)  
**Anayeli Mora** for her bottomless patience

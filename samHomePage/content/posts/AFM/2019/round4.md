# **AFM 2019 Round 4 at Thunderhill Raceway**
This round stood in contrast to round 3, primarily due to the far higher temperatures which reached up to 110F. I kept an eye on the pavement temperature, and saw it rise to almost 165F during racing! For me, the round was all about survival and consistency.  

<!--more-->  

With such high temperatures, tire stability was becoming a real issue, and even engine temperatures were running much higher than usual. The motor's cooling system depends on the outside air to be cooler in order to take heat out of the coolant. With the track temp being so close to the engine's running temperature, I was seeing engine temperature rise higher than ever before.  

On Saturday and Sunday, there were a couple nasty crashes, one for #360 Jayson Uribe, and one for #251 Kaleb De Keyrel. Both riders are OK, and recovering. Hope you guys are better soon!  

For myself, it was my first time racing in such heat, and I found I was struggling quite a bit to maintain focus on the more strategic aspects of racing, like analysis of opponents, and figuring out where ideal overtake locations would be. I found it was taking everything I had just to manage the traction of my tires, and my own endurance.  

The result is that, although I ran consistently in the 1:54s for laptimes, I was unable to set a new PB, and in battles I was often unable to press advantages in favor of keeping the bike under control. While I feel a bit dissatisfied with this, I am glad that both the bike and I made it to the end of the weekend with no major incident!  

Despite everything, this was actually my most successful weekend racing as an expert, with a 2nd place finish in 750 Superstock, and 3rd place finishes in 600 Superbike and Superstock!

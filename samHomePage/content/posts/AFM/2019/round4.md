# **AFM 2019 Round 4 at Thunderhill Raceway**
This round stood in contrast to round 3, primarily due to the far higher temperatures which reached up to 110F. I kept an eye on the pavement temperature, and saw it rise to almost 165F during racing! For me, the round was all about survival and consistency.  

<!--more-->  

With such high temperatures, tire stability was becoming a real issue, and even engine temperatures were running much higher than usual. The motor's cooling system depends on the outside air to be cooler in order to take heat out of the coolant. With the track temp being so close to the engine's running temperature, I was seeing engine temperature rise higher than ever before.  

On Saturday and Sunday, there were a couple nasty crashes, one for #360 Jayson Uribe, and one for #251 Kaleb De Keyrel. Both riders are OK, and recovering. Hope you guys are better soon!  

For myself, it was my first time racing in such heat, and I found I was struggling quite a bit to maintain focus on the more strategic aspects of racing, like analysis of opponents, and figuring out where ideal overtake locations would be. I found it was taking everything I had just to manage the traction of my tires, and my own endurance.  

The result is that, although I ran consistently in the 1:54s for laptimes, I was unable to set a new PB, and in battles I was often unable to press advantages in favor of keeping the bike under control. While I feel a bit dissatisfied with this, I am glad that both the bike and I made it to the end of the weekend with no major incident!  

Despite everything, this was actually my most successful weekend racing as an expert, with a 2nd place finish in 750 Superstock, and 3rd place finishes in 600 Superbike and Superstock!  

## **600 Superbike**
 I launch right behind #823 Rob Brittain and manage to secure the holeshot into turn 1, some deja vu from round 3. This doesn't last long, as #153 Valentin Debise cuts under me into turn 2. A real lesson in late trail braking, watch how smoothly Debise opens the gap up!  
 
 I manage to hold off #14 Stephen Rue until turn 14 in the first lap, settling into 3rd. Rue rides like he's on fire on the borrowed R6, and I have nothing for him at my pacing.

## **Formula 1**
I launch off the second row, and get hemmed into position 8 into turn 1. Not a good place to be when surrounded by hopped-up middleweights! I settle in behind #778 Grant Boldt, and start trying to work out how to improve my situation.

I manage to overtake Boldt in turn 9, and move in behind #829 Jesse Carter's GSXR750. While I have an edge on Jesse in the corners, his formidable 750, and his willingness to apply it enthusiastically, prevent me from pressing that advantage.

Our battle features guest appearances by #436 Gordon Pull, and Boldt, back for revenge! I finish in 7th behind Jesse and Gordon.

## **Formula Pacific**
FP is a 10 lap race, and with temperatures hovering between 106-108F, none of the tough guys are complaining. I fill up my suit with ice cubes, and miss the warm up lap. Amateur maneuver!

I launch off the 3rd row, surrounded by literbikes (and the gentleman #34 Sal Rizzo himself!). I run into turn 1 neck-and-neck with Sal, and overtake him into turn 2. Bringing the tires up to temperature in the first lap, I am behind #108 Kevin Murphy and #5 Jordan Edginton when #712 Nick Allison loses the rear coming down turn 5b, crashing out in a minor lowside.  

Murphy and Edginton walk away from me by the second lap, and I'm left with my slowly boiling thoughts, 100+ horsepower, and slowly roasting tires. I glance at the temperature display on the back straight each lap, noting it tick up one or two degrees at a time. With pavement temperatures of 165F, the motor's cooling system is barely adequate to keep the coolant under boiling temperature.  

I peer back at turn 9 periodically, and begin to notice a bike with a blue face winking at me from lap 5 onward. Is it getting closer? Could that be... #951 Dave Thomas?

Not only is it Dave, he has the audacity to show me a wheel entering Turn 1 on the final lap! While that exhibition doesn't show in the video, I throw everything I have into that last lap. Luckily for me, Dave is struggling with braking issues, and I'm able to gap him enough in turns 14-15 to beat him to the line! I finish 7th, my first top-10 finish in Formula Pacific!

## **600 Superstock**
An exciting launch into turn 1 has me abreast of #15 Berto Wooldridge and #14 Stephen Rue. Rue jukes outward to avoid Berto, and we briefly touch as I move outward to give him space. Well, more of a caress but you'd have to ask Rue if that was acceptable!  

This slows nothing down as we charge into turn 2, and I settle into 3rd as I steam after the top men.

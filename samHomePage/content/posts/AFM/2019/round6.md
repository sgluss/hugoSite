# **AFM 2019 Round 6 at Thunderhill Raceway**

<!--more-->  


## **600 Superbike**
A battle with #586 Dan Riser for third enters the final lap. I'm able to snake past lap traffic into turn 14, but the bike powerslides coming out of turn 15. I'm able to recover initially, but the recovery ends up being so violent that I lose the rear again, and low-side. This was a very disappointing end to this race, but the bike did start right up again. With only 90 minutes left before grid for F1, there was no time to wallow, and the team and I got right to work getting the machine fit to fight again.

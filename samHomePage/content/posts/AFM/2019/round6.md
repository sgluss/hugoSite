# **AFM 2019 Round 6 at Thunderhill Raceway**
Round 6 had new challenges, despite being the third round of the season at everyones favorite track. Highly variable winds and temperature brought a challenge to practice, as morning warmup was complicated by a stone cold track and sudden gusts. In the afternoon the sun would come out and the winds would settle, but this would require further adjustment to compensate for braking points moving around.

## **600 Superbike**
A battle with #586 Dan Riser for third enters the final lap. I'm able to snake past lap traffic into turn 14, but the bike powerslides coming out of turn 15. I'm able to recover initially, but the recovery ends up being so violent that I lose the rear again, and low-side. This was a very disappointing end to this race, but the bike did start right up again. With only 90 minutes left before grid for F1, there was no time to wallow, and the team and I got right to work getting the machine fit to fight again.

## **Formula 1**
With the bike fixed up just in time, I rolled out to the grid. Unfortunately there was no time to get the camera set up again, so there is no video. I was mainly happy to just be back out on the bike, so I focused on riding clean laps and minimizing risk. 

I settled in behind #823 Robert Brittain and #768 Nick Lundquist, and battled with them for the entire race. I set up an overtake on Nick as we wrestled with lap trafic in turn 7 on the last lap, putting me at 5th over the finish line.

## **Formula Pacific**
I get a good start, and try to stick with #108 Kevin Murphy for as long as possible. I lose him, and am then overtaken

## **600 Superstock**
Running consistently off pace at low 55s, I set up behind #14 Stephen Rue and hang on for a 5th place finish.

## **750 Superbike**
With a hot launch into Turn 1 pretty much side by side with #823 Brittain and #15 Wooldridge, I engage in a fierce battle for 3rd with Brittain. While I am able to gain an advantage on him in turn 8 and 9, he routinely pulls me into turn 1. We end the race with Rob beating me to the line by only 1 millisecond of separation between transponders!

At 130 miles per hour, 1 millisecond translates to only 2.28 inches. This means that had I located my transponder on the fork leg, rather than the sprocket cover, I would have gained nearly 15ms! When I got home, you can guess what the first modification I made to the bike was. In any case, this was a thrilling battle, and a great way to end the round.

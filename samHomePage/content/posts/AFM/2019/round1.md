# **AFM 2019 Round 1 at Buttonwillow Raceway**


<!--more-->  



## **600 Superbike**
A frantic start leads to running off the edge of the track coming into Phil Hill. Somehow this only costs me one position, then the race is back on!  
I chase up to 13th but end up too far behind the rest of the pack to do anything meaningful.


## **Formula 1**
I get an awesome run off the front row into turn 1, but am not able to keep my lap times low enough! I spend much of the race battling #312 Keir Leonhardt for 5th, but ultimately drop back to 7th on the last lap due to lap traffic.  

## **Formula Pacific**


## **600 Superstock**


## **750 Superbike**

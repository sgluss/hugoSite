# **AFM 2019 Round 1 at Buttonwillow Raceway**


<!--more-->  



## **600 Superbike**
A frantic start leads to running off the edge of the track coming into Phil Hill. Somehow this only costs me one position, then the race is back on!  
I chase up to 13th but end up too far behind the rest of the pack to do anything meaningful.


## **Formula 1**
I get an awesome run off the front row into turn 1, but am not able to keep my lap times low enough! I spend much of the race battling #312 Keir Leonhardt for 5th, but ultimately drop back to 7th on the last lap due to lap traffic. I'm able to match my best lap from qualifying, but I'll need to go a LITTLE faster to beat the top middleweight racers in AFM!   


## **Formula Pacific**
My first run in the premier class with AFM, and by popular request it's a 15 lap race! I'm able to make it to the second to last lap before I get lapped by the leader, so it ends up being a 14 lap race for me.  

I am able to skirmish a bit in the first couple of laps, but drop back a little to conserve energy. This ends up being a good plan, because although I can't catch the two riders a bit ahead of me, my laptimes stay consistent, and I also stay out of reach of the competitors behind. I roll through the checkered and say to myself, "14 laps, no big deal!"  

## **600 Superstock**
I battle up from 21st to 11th, but am not able to close the gap to #34 Sal Rizzo. Sal and I will get to battle in the next round when grids are set on points!

## **750 Superbike**
I skirmish with #823 Robert Brittain, who has a couple of scary moments! Then, I am overtaken by and chase #312 Keir Leonhardt for the rest of the race.  
In the final lap I'm able to close it up and try to set up an overtake right at the line on the last lap, but I can't quite out-accelerate Keir at the line. Ah well, that's racing!

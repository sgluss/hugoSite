# **AFM 2019 Round 2 at Buttonwillow Raceway**


<!--more-->  



## **600 Superbike**
A relatively uneventful race despite the grid being stacked with some of the fastest talent on the west coast. I get a good launch but run a poor first lap.  
I manage to get my laptimes down and claw my way to a 10th place finish.

## **Formula 1**
Starting from dead last in the expert grid, I am able to move up quickly to battle with many friends from the 2018 season: #775 Nick Csik, #966 Grant Cowan, and #124 Jackson Burkhart.
Nick and I narrowly avoid an accident exiting in sweeper. I press forward, finishing 11th.

## **Formula Pacific - Battle of Two Kings**
Another last-place start, I am able to jump into the pack with a solid launch. I get into a battle with #69 James King, and we are suddenly joined by #116 Jeremy King.  
What ensues is the most exciting battle of the season so far! I am able to gain ground in the corners, but am no match for the overwhelming power of the large displacement bikes when the track opens up.  
I worry that I will burn myself out with the intensity of the riding, but the adrenaline from the close engagement keeps me going strong to a 17th place finish when the race is red-flagged at the 8th lap due to a downed bike in the middle of the track.  

## **600 Superstock and 750 Superbike**
Due to what turns out to be a spark plug failure and critically low compression, it was not possible to run my final two races of the weekend. I picked the wrong round to leave the 600RR at home!

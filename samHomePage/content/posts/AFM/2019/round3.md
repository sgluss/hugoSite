## **Vendors**
[**CT Race Tires**](http://www.ctracetires.com/) for keeping me set up with the stickiest rubber
**Marc Salvisberg** at [FactoryPro](http://www.factorypro.com/) for turning around a same-day tune which made big-kid power and rode smooth as butter.  
**Jim and Nickie** at [Catalyst Reaction](https://www.crstuning.com/) for always supporting me, even when I do really dumb stuff like use a clip-style master link.  
[**Dave Moss**](https://davemosstuning.com/) for thinking of completely outside-the-box solutions to my ergonomics issues, making the bike more comfortable and easy to ride!

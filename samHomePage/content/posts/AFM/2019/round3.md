Two weeks before this event began, I burned out the motor in my R6 at a Carters@thetrack trackday at Thunderhill East event.
- engine tune
- saturday struggles

## **600 Superbike**
I get a great launch and am able to secure first place coming out of turn 1... my first ever holeshot in any race! The sensation of looking out towards turn 2 and seeing only daylight and farmland was immediately tempered by the awareness that I had two of the fastest middleweights in AFM breathing right up my tailpipe... #164 Cory Ventura and #6 Brandon Crawford. I'm able to hold them off for a half lap or so, then settle into 3rd place.  

\#14 Stephen Rue catches up to me at the end of lap 3, and overtakes me at the end of lap 4. I stick with him but am unable to make any overtake attempt... Rue is crafty and an extremely precise rider! In the end I set a new Thunderhill PB of 1:54.6, so the R6 has finally earned its stripes!  

Unfortunately my camera didn't capture this race, but Rue's did! He's been kinda enough to let me share it here, so definitely give it a watch and see how easy he makes everything look!

## **Formula 1**
I move to 4th in the 1st lap, and begin what ends up being a race long battle against #152 Patrick Murphy, punctuated by a finish-line overtake by #768 Nick Lundquist. I'm able to out-roll Patrick out of turn 8 in the 3rd lap, and secure 3rd... but not for long. Patrick surges past me on the front straight right at the tower! He's not able to make the pass stick coming into turn 1, but this continues lap after lap: Patrick gets me right before the line, and I take back 3rd in T1 or T2.  

I quickly realize I have a problem: he beats me to the finish line, every time. and the number of laps is dwindling fast... I formulate a plan: I need more speed, and I'm not in a position to make a phone call to my tuner. On the final lap, I swing extra wide on the entrance to the final corner, and open the throttle completely earlier than ever before. I tuck in on the straight like I'm racing a 300, expecting Patrick to cruise past me at any moment. The finish line approaches so slowly, while the shift light flashes uselessly. I pass the line, and Patrick passes me up almost immediately... but he didn't get me this time.  

I beat him to the line by 0.064 seconds, setting by best lap for the race of 1:54.84! This 3rd place finish marks my first expert podium!

## **Formula Pacific**
The premier race, the big one! Out at Thunderhill the big bikes rule, and FP brings no shortage. I roll out onto the grid with a new Pirelli SC0 on the rear, piping hot and ready to dig in against these one-liter monsters.  

In this race I get into what ends up being a 12 lap battle with #712 Nick Allison, a Carters instructor and consummate gentleman. Getting a front row seat to his fire-breathing ZX10r leave dark lines out of corners to accumulate tremendous speed in the straights was an awesome experience.  

We eventually reeled in #251 Kaleb De Keyrel, and the more the merrier! I was never really able to force an opening with either of the more powerful bikes, but I enjoyed looking for one regardless. We stayed tight to the end of the race, where I finished 12th and set a new Thunderhill East PB of 1:53.9, dropping nearly a full second from the morning! Maybe it was the SC0?

## **600 Superstock**
The first lap of this race is spent tangling with #823 Robert Brittain, then suddenly overtaking #188 in the entrance of turn 2 on the second lap. at this point I'm in 6th, and #251 Kaleb De Keyrel is a distant 5th. I figure there is no way I'll catch him, but I inch slowly closer, and in the final lap traffic presents a unique opportunity in the back straight!  

I build enough speed to come up the inside of Kaleb into turn 14 (the 'Nick Csik' maneuver) and manage to hold the lead to the line, securing 5th overall.

## **750 Superbike**
An awful launch involving a mis-shift to second puts me in a bad spot off the line, but roll speed in 1 gets me back in the game. I'm able to scoot past #251 Kaleb De Keyrel and #823 Robert Brittain between turns 2 and 3, then get to lead the race for a little while!  

Kaleb passes me again at the end of the third lap, and I'm unable to take the lead back. I finish behind him, my first 2nd place expert finish!

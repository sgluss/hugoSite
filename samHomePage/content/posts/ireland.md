# Journeys in Ireland
First of all, this has been an incredible trip! Now that the dust has settled, I think I want to organize this post into three parts:
- The experience of exploring the cities, towns, and rural areas of Ireland
- The actual experience of engaging in Irish road racing, as someone with American short circuit experience
- The logistics and bureacratic maneuverings that were required to engage in regional Irish road races as an American citizen

## Dublin, Beginnings and Endings
Vijay and I started our adventure in the city of Dublin. This was largely due to the nonstop flights available from San Francisco, and we opted to stay a few days to explore, primarily in the Temple Bar district.

In Temple Bar we found a vibrant night life, whether we were pub crawling for outstanding beer and bar food, or exploring fine eating both foreign and domestic. During the day there are no shortage of sights to see, with plenty of museums and historical sights to explore.

We were able to rent a van for the duration of our travels in Ireland, although it did need to be returned to Dublin at the end of our trip, so we couldn't fly out of Belfast which might have been more convenient for the next leg of our trip.

The van was the cheapest option available, and with a 6 speed manual gearbox and a small displacement turbo diesel motor, it was enjoyable to drive, got 35mpg, and could easily carry bikes and gear as needed. I highly recommend this option!

# Roadracing in Ireland
## Bureacracy and Logistics
Irish road races are orchestrated by a governing body known as the MCUI: Motor Cycle Union of Ireland.

This is definitely *NOT* the fun part, but it is absolutely necessary to get this right. You will essentially need 4 things to participate in an MCUI (but not FIM) sanctioned road race:
- you will need proof of insurance, which meets or exceeds the insurance minimums specified by the MCUI
- your "racing license" which for Americans will be a start permission slip with NO insurance, issued by the AMA (note, you MUST be an AMA member for the duration of the event)
- an entry form for that road race, properly filled out
- you will need a bike. I was able to borrow a machine from Eric Wilson of Obsession Engineering, but most will either need to ship a bike, or rent one. Note that shipping may take a highly variable amount of time... up to 6 months, one way.

## Insurance
Insurance is likely to be the most burdensome part of participating in an Irish road race.

Please note the insurance requirements found in this link: https://manxgrandprix.org/mgp-newcomers-info/

Your personal insurance must meet or exceed these requirements:
25,000 Euros – Death 
50,000 Euros - Temporary Partial Disablement (Disability)
185,000 Euros - Medical Treatment 
75,000 Euros – Repatriation costs

Furthermore, your insurance must be valid internationally, and must not have an exemption for motorcycle competition.

I was able to secure these requirements through the following companies:

Medical and death

Disability I was able to get through Brandon Parrish of Ridersurance:

Were I to do it all again, I'd suggest getting the insurance settled well ahead of time, and contact a broker first (I cannot recommend Brandon Parrish highly enough for this purpose).


## Start Permission (Race license)
First off, I want to address what I would consider to be the prerequisite level of experience to participate in an Irish road race.

The ACU (Auto Cycle Union) describes their National license requirements as follows:
Clubman licence holders who have obtained upgrade signatures for a minimum of 10 separate [Expert] Race Days at 3 different circuits during the
current year and preceding 2 years may apply to be upgraded to a National Licence. To obtain an upgrade signature, riders must appear
in the official race results as a finisher and have an average race speed greater than 92.5% of their respective CLASS winner.

As an American, you simply need to submit a request to the AMA for start permission WITHOUT INSURANCE FROM THE AMA for the events in which you would like to participate.

## Entry Form
Your race entry should be submitted ideally several months before the event is to take place. It may be submitted no later than 1 month prior to the event.

You may find the entry form on the event's website. An example for the Tandragee 100:
https://tandragee100.co.uk/competitors/

fill this out properly, and submit it to the event coordinators. At least for the Cookstown and Tandragee road races, you should check if there is a Facebook group for racers, where you may find more up-to-date info (the websites are often updated less frequently).

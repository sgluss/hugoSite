# **AFM 2018 Round 2 at Buttonwillow Raceway**
This round was relatively uneventful. I was struggling with rear tire traction, which made it difficult to drive my laptimes down to my 1:55 goal.  

Despite that, the battles were more intense than ever, with lots of overtaking.

## **Practice with Dave Thomas**
The racing hadn't even started yet, and I had a great time going all-out with Dave on his venerable S1000RR.

## **Clubman Middleweight**
Great battle with #775 Nick Csik, followed by a surprise as Paolo rejoined the track in the second to last lap at bus stop. A short battle with the Aprilia, and I was able to secure first.

## **750 Superbike**
Things get heated as the battling with Nick gets even more intense, he rides to 1st and I ride to 2nd.

## **600 Superbike**
Amazing battle with Nick Csik, but sadly my camera battery failed so there is no video. I took second place to Nick, who secured an amazing finish-line overtake in the last lap.

## **Formula 1**
A bit of an off race for me, I must need to work on my endurance! I finished 4th.

## **Legacy Middleweight**
A ZX6 in my class gets a phenomenal start. After battling him, I'm able to ride to a clean 1st place finish.
